# RamanChain

## 📘 Description
**RamanChain** is a next-generation blockchain focused on efficiency, security, and scalability, integrating advanced **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** technologies. This blockchain uses an innovative consensus mechanism called **Proof of Mathematic Integrity (PoMI)**, based on Ramanujan's formulas, and an alternative **Proof of Learning (PoL)** mechanism, which applies Federated Learning to maximize the computational power of miners.

## 🚀 Main Features

- **Proof of Mathematic Integrity (PoMI)**: Validates blocks through complex mathematical equations, adjusting complexity based on network data.
- **Proof of Learning (PoL)**: Miners collaborate to train AI models, earning rewards for their participation.
- **Staking and Rewards**: Staking system for **Arc** and **Ranj** coins, with rewards based on staking time and amount.
- **Self-Healing Smart Contracts**: Detects and corrects vulnerabilities automatically.
- **Intelligent Stablecoins**: Adjusts value automatically based on AI algorithms.
- **Fraud Detection**: AI algorithms identify suspicious behavior.
- **Energy Consumption Optimization**: Adjusts complexity to minimize consumption.
- **Automated Portfolio Management**: AI manages cryptocurrency portfolio allocations to maximize user returns.
